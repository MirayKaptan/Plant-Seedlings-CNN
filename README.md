# Plant-Seedlings-CNN

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to classify plant seedlings using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing techniques. 
The notebook walks through various steps including dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

This project uses the Plant Seedlings Classification Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains images for both training and testing purposes, organized into folders for each plant species. 

- `train/`: Contains images for training the model.
- `test/`: Contains images for testing and evaluating the model.

You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedling
